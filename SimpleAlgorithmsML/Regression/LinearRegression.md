# Linear Regression
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (also called the outcome or target 
variable) and one or more independent variables (also called predictors or features). The goal of linear regression is to find the 
best-fitting line through the data points, which can be represented by the following equation:

`y = beta_0 + beta_1 * x_1 + beta_2 * x_2 + ... + beta_n * x_n`

where y is the dependent variable, x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are the independent variables, beta_0 is the y-intercept of the line, and beta_1, 
beta_2, ..., beta_n are the coefficients that determine the slope of the line for each independent variable.

In terms of implementation, the scikit-learn library in Python provides an easy-to-use implementation of linear regression through the 
LinearRegression class. Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample data
x = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 10]])
y = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Create an instance of the LinearRegression class
model = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model to the data
model.fit(x, y)

# Print the coefficients
print(model.coef_)

# Print the intercept
print(model.intercept_)
```

This will output the coefficients and intercept of the line that best fits the data.

To sum up, Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more 
independent variables. The equation of a linear regression line is represented by 
y = beta_0 + beta_1 * x_1 + beta_2 * x_2 + ... + beta_n * x_n.
