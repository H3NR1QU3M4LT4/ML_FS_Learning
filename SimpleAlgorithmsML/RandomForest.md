# Random Forest Algorithm

### Explanation
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method for classification and regression. It creates multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve 
the overall accuracy and stability of the model. Random Forest introduces randomness in the creation of decision trees to reduce overfitting, which is a 
common problem in decision tree algorithms.

### Formula
The formula for the Random Forest algorithm is as follows:

`f(x) = average(f_i(x)) for i = 1 to n_estimators`

where `f(x)` is the prediction of the Random Forest model, `f_i(x)` is the prediction of the i-th decision tree, and `n_estimators` is the number of 
decision trees used in the ensemble.

### scikit-learn Implementation

Here is an example of how to implement the Random Forest algorithm using scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

# Generate data
X, y = make_classification(n_features=4, n_classes=2)

# Create the model
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)

# Train the model
clf.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
```
